## Fingerprint Biometrics

### Installing
Required python modules:
	- opencv-python
	- picamera (for later implementation)


###
This project is an exercise in utilizing images of fingerprints to perform biometric validation.
Initial cleaning is performed on the image, and a Gabor filter is used to emphasize the fingerprint.

The fingerprint is then skeletonized, converting thick lines into line vectors.
